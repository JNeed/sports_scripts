This is a project designed to help with sports betting.

You can view players' stats and you can even view multiple players at a time.

Data is colored based on minutes played in a given game because a person betting might want to know how much a player is expected to play before making a bet on them.

Non-dot symbols indicate injuries.

This project is unfinished - I wanted to give the option to aggregate across multiple players e.g. to see the sum of multiple players' points across several games, though I didn't get to that and I would like to put this project down for now. I also need to fix the legend... Ideally, I would like it to both reflect which colorscale is assigned to which player and which symbols represent injuries for which player.
