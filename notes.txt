- navigate directly to a player's game log page (url for each player and each game log follows the same pattern)

ex: kevin durant: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01.html

pattern is /players/first char of last name/first 5 chars of last name, first 2 chars of first name, 01.html
# what if their last name has less than 5 letters though?
# if their last name has less than 5 letters, just use all of the letters in the last name, still stick to 2 in first name

- Shortened timeout and used try-except (handle timeout exception b/c ads never load)

    - Actually can just navigate to player's gamelog page and get the table with pd.read_html(url)

- could maybe examine a matchup and projected starters and display the points and injuries for all the projected starters
    with each player having their own data point color

- Maybe could find a page that displays all active players and could store that info in a database and make a call 
    to that database from the app to display a dropdown of players for example.
