What I Tried:
    - At first I thought I needed to explore async because of the slow loading ads...
    - Then I thought maybe a try except into a scroll.

What I Learned:
    - I think setting the timeout to something short and using a try except is a good idea because otherwise, the page.goto 
        command won't terminate until the ads fully render.

    - I don't think a scroll is necessary... I'm pretty sure the entire DOM is rendered when you visit the page, even the parts that 
        aren't visible
